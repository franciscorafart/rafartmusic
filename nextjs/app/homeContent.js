            "text": "I just released the song The Alienation Dance as an interactive web application. In the app you'll be able to both listen the song and do a live mix of it by dragging the different instruments on the screen.\n\nThis experiment is my attempt to \"extend\" the digital musical experience beyond hitting play on a playlist. I'm trying to create a more personal relationship between you and the song by allowing you to interact with it.\n\nI recommend using a desktop computer and headphones for the experience, as it will allow you to drag icons and appreciate the subtle changes of the mix better.\n\nThe Alienation Dance web app is part of a larger project called The Great Refusal, an audiovisual musical performance that was made possible by a Live Arts Boston (LAB) grant by the Boston Foundation.\n\nThe animations were created by Brazilian artist Benjamin Ramos."
