        { tag: "p", text: "Always have reference tracks that represent the sound you're aiming for. This helps maintain perspective during long mixing sessions." },

        { tag: "p", text: "While visual feedback from plugins is helpful, your ears are the ultimate judge. If it sounds good, it probably is good." },
        { tag: "h2", text: "4. Less is More" },
        { tag: "p", text: "Don't over-process your tracks. Sometimes the most powerful production choice is knowing when to leave something alone." },

        { tag: "h2", text: "Learning Curve" },
        { tag: "p", text: "Learning the Stick was unlike any other instrument I had played. The technique requires independence between both hands, similar to piano, but with the physical approach of a stringed instrument." },
        { tag: "p", text: "The first few months were challenging, but the musical possibilities kept me motivated to push through the initial difficulties." },
        { tag: "h2", text: "Musical Impact" },
        { tag: "p", text: "The Chapman Stick has shaped my compositional approach. It naturally leads to complex harmonic structures and allows for intricate interplay between bass and melody lines." },
